## Welcome to Forrest Burt's GitHub page
This page will have updates about my ongoing programming projects. To see all of my creative work, go to www.forrestburt.com.

My current projects are:

1. **Steganography**  - Based on the idea of hiding images within other images using manipulation of the least significant bits of individual pixels.

2. **Map Generator** - Uses simplex noise procedural generation to generate maps.

3. **Aud2BMP** - A project related to databending that will allow for the conversion of audio files into valid .bmp files.

All of these are in various states of development and will be updated as often as I can.
